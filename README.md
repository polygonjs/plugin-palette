# Polygonjs Palette Plugin

This adds a Palette SOP node to the [Polygonjs webgl engine](https://polygonjs.com).

_Note that the plugin has now been moved into the core of Polygonjs, so there is no need to install the plugin as it is always available_. See [Documentation](https://polygonjs.com/docs/nodes/sop/palette)
